3. Scenario: You are working on a project that involves analyzing a dataset containing information
about houses in a neighborhood. The dataset is stored in a CSV file, and you have imported it into a
NumPy array named house_data. Each row of the array represents a house, and the columns contain
various features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and sale price.
Question: Using NumPy arrays and operations, how would you find the average sale price of houses
with more than four bedrooms in the neighborhood?

import numpy as np
house_data = np.array([
    [3, 1200, 250000],
    [5, 1800, 450000],
    [4, 1500, 350000],
    [6, 2200, 550000],
    [5, 2000, 500000]
])
houses = house_data[house_data[:, 0] > 4]
average_price = np.mean(houses[:, 2])
print("Average Sale Price:", average_price)
